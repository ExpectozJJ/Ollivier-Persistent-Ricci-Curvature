# Ollivier-Persistent-Ricci-Curvature

This repository includes the codes used in the work of Ollivier Persistent Ricci Curvature (OPRC) in Protein-Ligand Binding Affinity Predictions. This work has shown that OPRC delivers meaningful and interesting geometrical features in biomolecular data which is able to predict binding affinities with comparable performance to many existing traditional molecular descriptors and advanced mathematical based machine learning models.

It can also be seen that the geometrical information gathered from ORC also plays as an unique feature in differentiating osmolytes in hydrogen bonding networks.
