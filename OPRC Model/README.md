The list of python files consists of all the subfunctions used in dataset preparation of PDBbind v2007, v2013 and v2016. 

For each PDBbind dataset:
The train list is the numpy array of PDB IDs in the refined set but not in core set. 
The test list is the numpy array of PDB IDs in the coreset. 
Both lists can be generated from preplist.py

Original Datasets can be downloaded from www.pdbbind.org.cn.
